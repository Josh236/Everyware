This is a project completed by using scrapy, ibm watson and matplotlibs.

To recreate the outputs outlined in the Demo folder, navigate to matplotdrawer.py in the Source Code folder, run it.
You will notice in the console it logs a quote from quotes.json with a response from ibm watson also, then a 
seperate window will open with a shape related to the emotion outlined.

The scraping portion of the project can be found in Source Code/quotesscraper/firstpro/spiders/scrape.py

This data is extremely useful as each quote conveys a certain emotion which ibm watson finds.  When I attempted to 
find some other data to scrape, I was unable to get the correct <div> to import to scrapy.
